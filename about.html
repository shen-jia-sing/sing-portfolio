                        <h2>How I Got Here</h2>
                        <p>
                            I am currently a fourth-year student at the American University of Phnom Penh (AUPP),
                            majoring in Information and
                            Communication Technology (ICT). My journey into technology started with a curiosity about
                            how digital products are
                            built, which naturally led me to explore both front-end and back-end development. Over time,
                            this hands on experience
                            shaped me into a fullstack developer who enjoys turning ideas into functional,
                            user-friendly solutions.

                            Beyond technology, volleyball has played a major role in shaping who I am today. As the
                            current President of the AUPP
                            Volleyball Club, I’ve had the opportunity to lead, motivate, and grow a competitive team.
                            Under my leadership, our team
                            achieved second and third place finishes across multiple tournaments and earned several
                            medals. These experiences taught
                            me discipline, teamwork, and leadership skills that strongly influence how I approach my
                            work in tech.

                            I’m deeply motivated by continuous learning and personal growth. I actively seek out new
                            knowledge, whether through
                            hands-on projects, certifications, or competitive environments. This combination of
                            technical curiosity, leadership
                            experience, and a strong drive to learn is what brought me to where I am today and it
                            continues to push me forward.

                                    I value the freedom to explore ideas, express myself, and work creatively. Having
                                    space to think independently allows me
                                    to grow, stay motivated, and produce work that feels authentic and meaningful.

                                    Creativity shapes how I solve problems and approach challenges. I enjoy
                                    experimenting, thinking from different
                                    perspectives, and turning ideas into practical solutions while continuously
                                    improving my skills.

                                    I believe kindness creates better environments and stronger teams. I aim to be
                                    friendly, approachable, and easy to work
                                    with, making collaboration feel comfortable and positive. People who work with me
                                    often appreciate my openness and

                                        As his sister, I can say he’s someone who knows how to have fun, but when it
                                        comes to work, he’s very serious and
                                        responsible. He’s hardworking, dependable, and always gives his best to what he
                                        does. People enjoy being around him
                                        because he’s friendly and approachable, but they also trust him because he gets
                                        things done. I’m proud of him and
                                        confidently recommend him.
